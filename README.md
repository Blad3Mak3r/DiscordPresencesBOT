# Discord Presences BOT
 
**Discord Presences BOT** is a bot designed for the Among Us Spanish Discord server. You are free to fork the code, build the project and use it for your own benefit.

This bot shows how many users are playing **Among Us** on the server, or whatever game you define in [environment variables](#run-with-environment-variables).

## How to?

### Prerequisites
This project requires JVM 11 and Kotlin 1.4.0

### Discord Bot Token
To be able to log in with a bot you need a Discord Bot Token, follow [our guide][DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_WIKI] to get one and configure it correctly.
